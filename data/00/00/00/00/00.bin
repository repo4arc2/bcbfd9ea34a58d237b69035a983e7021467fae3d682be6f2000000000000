Previously on WandaVision.

我叫旺达
I'm Wanda.

20
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,600
我是杰拉丁
I'm, uh... Geraldine.

21
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,180
-旺达  旺达  -那是谁
- Wanda. Wanda? - Who is that?

22
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,150
你们生下了两个非常健康的男孩
You've got two healthy baby boys on your hands.

23
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,340
杰拉丁是不是跟旺达在里面
Is Geraldine inside with Wanda?

24
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,880
真是不敢相信  双胞胎
Can you believe it? Twins!

25
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,930
她是才来到镇上的
She's new to town.

26
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,300
-没有家  -什么叫她没有家
- No home. - What do you mean, she has no home?

27
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,910
她来这儿是因为我们都
She came here because we're all...

28
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,690
她来这儿是因为你们都什么
She came here because we're all what?

29
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,330
那个标志是什么
What is that symbol?

30
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,110
-旺达  -不
- Wanda. - No.

31
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,460
我觉得你应该离开了
I think you should leave.

32
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,170
-不  我不能  我不能丢下莫妮卡  -妈妈
- No, I can't. I can't leave Monica.- Mom?

33
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,310
妈妈  没事  我可以去外婆家住
It's okay, I can stay with Grandma and...

34
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,970
我不能去
I can't leave.

35
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,850
或许我可以建艘飞船
Maybe I'll build a spaceship.

36
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,900
我想做个飞行员
I wanna be an aircraft pilot.

37
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,420
天上发孩子时  给了她最坚强的一个
When they were handing out kids they gave her the toughest one.

38
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,080
捣蛋中尉
Lieutenant Trouble.

39
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,030
帮帮忙
Somebody help!

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,760
-不好意思  -他们都在重新出现
- Excuse me... - They're all coming back.

41
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,380
我们忙不过来
We don't have the capacity.

42
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,640
不好意思  我在找一位病人  104房
Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient. In room 104...

43
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,910
-谁  我妻子吗  你有手机吗  -没有
- Who, my wife? Do you have a phone? - No.

44
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,410
我得联系我妻子
I have to call my wife.

45
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,870
小心
Watch out!

46
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,920
我来帮你
Let me help you.

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,720
-你没事吧  慢慢来  -我来吧
- Are you okay? You okay? Take it... - I got him. I got him

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
你没事吧
Are you okay?

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,820
不好意思  我在找104房的一位病人
Excuse me. I'm looking for a patient in room number 104.

50
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,410
我不知道该跟你说什么
I don't know what to tell you.

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,620
-莫妮卡  -哈里医生  谢天谢地
- Monica? - Oh, Dr. Harley, thank God!

52
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,810
难以置信
I can't believe it.

53
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,130
-我刚刚...  -你去哪了
- Uh, I was... - Where did you go?

54
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,540
她手术结束后  我就一直在她房里
Well, in her room since she came back from the surgery.

55
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,160
我可能睡着了
I mean, I might've have fallen asleep,

56
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,240
但也就20分钟吧
but no longer than 20 minutes.

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,210
哈里医生  我妈妈在哪
Dr. Harley, where's my mom?

58
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,760
你妈妈死了  亲爱的
Your mom, she died, honey.

59
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,310
什么
What?

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,790
不  不不  你错了
No. No, no, no, no, you're mistaken.

61
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,550
我妈妈...手术很顺利
My mother... The procedure went well.

62
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,570
你自己也说了  风险极低
You said so yourself. Clean margins.

63
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,320
你今天本打算让她出院的
You're discharging her today.

64
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,200
癌症后来复发了
The cancer came back.

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,410
好吧  打住  我妈妈是玛利亚·兰博
Okay, stop, stop. No, you're... My mom is Maria Rambeau.

66
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,030
去查查看
Look it up. I mean...

67
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,440
-查查看  "玛利亚·兰博"  -莫妮卡
- Look it up. "Maria Rambeau." - Monica,

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
我不懂发生了什么
I don't understand what's happening,

69
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
但你得听好
but you need to listen to me.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,550
玛利亚三年前去世了
Maria died three years ago.

71
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,580
-三  不  不  -就在那两年之前你...
- Three? No. No. No, no... - Which was two years after you...

72
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,290
我怎么了
After I what?

73
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,130
我怎么了
After I what?

74
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,660
你消失了
After you disappeared.

Ma'am? Over here, please.

79

早上好  我在这里工作
Hi, good morning. I work here, and...

80
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,890
如果真是这样  你的徽章就不该不好用了
If you did, your badge would work, wouldn't it?

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,170
是啊
Right. Um...

82
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,650
-我约好了见...  -你知道这是谁吗
- I have a meeting with... - You know who this is?

莫妮卡·兰博上尉

代理局长  你一天都没老
Acting Director. You haven't aged a day.

87
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,650
你老得不像样
And you look old as hell.

88
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,960
来吧  给你说说情况
Come on, let's catch you up.

89
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,880
{\an8}"光子"玛利亚·兰博

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,220
已经三周了  你是第一个来报告的
It's been three weeks and you're the first to report.

91
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,190
我并不意外  上尉
Can't say I'm surprised, Captain.

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,720
航天员训练项目的人员怎么样了
How are the numbers for the astronaut training program?

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,140
不妙  "闪烁"让我失去了半数人员
Dismal. Lost half my personnel in The Blip

94
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,460
剩下的一半也吓破了胆
and half of those remaining have lost their nerve.

95
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,450
项目跟有你在时
The program hasn't been

96
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,810
可大不一样了  兰博
the same since you've been up there, Rambeau.

97
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,340
重心从载人任务
Shifted away from manned missions

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,930
移向了机器人  纳米科技  人工智能
and refocused on robotics, nanotech, AI.

99
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,220
有知觉武器  像门口写的那样
Sentient Weapons, like it says on the door.

100
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,930
门口还写了"观察和响应"
It also says "Observation and Response" on that door,

101
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,410
而不是"创造"
not "Creation."

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,620
世界跟你走之前不一样了
World's not the same as you left it.

103
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,180
太空现在满是难料的威胁
Space is now full of unexpected threats.

104
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,120
一向如此  到处有威胁  有盟友
Always was full of threats. And allies.

105
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,840
听着  莫妮卡  我想承认
Listen, Monica, I just wanna

106
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,730
情况非常尴尬
acknowledge the awkwardness of the situation.

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,160
我知道天剑局是你的家
I know S.W.O.R.D.'s your home.

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
你妈妈从零建立起了这里
Your mom built this place from the ground up.

109
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,970
你在这里长大
You grew up here.

110
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,800
你本该参与选定接替者的
You should've been here to help name the replacement.

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,640
你是不二人选
You were the obvious choice.

112
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,340
-我是唯一人选  -我没打算那么说的
- I was the only choice. - I wasn't gonna say it.

113
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,700
泰勒  你清楚你要做什么工作
Look, Tyler, you know the job you have to do.

114
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,220
我要来做我的
I'm here to do mine.

115
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,310
{\an8}局长

116
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,460
让你投入实地工作吧
Let's get you back out there.

117
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,960
联调局因为一起
The FBI is in a tizzy

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,710
新泽西州的失踪人口案非常慌张
over a missing persons case up in Jersey...

119
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,020
-"失踪人口"  -是啊  但他们要求使用
- "Missing persons"? - I know. But they have requested use

120
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,790
我们的成像无人机  我需要位陪同
of one of our imaging drones, and I need a chaperone.

121
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,200
泰勒  一般是无人机陪同我
Tyler, drones usually chaperone me.

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,540
-我理解  -如果这是因为
- I get it. - Look, if this is because of...

123
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,900
你不必担心我  我很好
You don't have to worry about me. I'm good.

124
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,300
这话没法委婉地说  但你被限制外出了
There's no easy way to say this, but you're grounded.

125
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,220
-什么  -仅能执行地球任务
- I'm sorry, what? - Terrestrial missions only.

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,630
你开玩笑呢
You're kidding.

127
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,070
多久  这是谁定的规章
For how long? Whose protocol is this?

128
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,670
你妈妈
Your mother's.

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,440
她颁布了针对
She implemented guidelines

130
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,940
失踪人口回归后的应对指导方针
in the event vanished personnel ever returned.

131
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,940
我知道这不公平  但还有一个好处
Look, I know it's a raw deal, but there is one positive takeaway.

132
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,220
-什么  -她相信你终会回来
- What's that? - She believed you'd come back.

133
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,360
如果你去办联调局的案子就是帮我们大忙
You'd be doing me a big favor with this FBI thing,

134
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,380
-但如果你还需要时间  -不
- but if you need more time... - No.

135
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,880
-不  我可以去  -太好了
- No. I'm good to go. - Excellent.

136
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,410
有事通知我  上尉
Keep me updated, Captain.

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,260

好  没问题
Okay. No problem.

141

143
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,030
怎么回事  吴探员
What's the story here, Agent Woo?

144
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,250
我在西景镇有一名证人
I've got a witness set up down the road in Westview,

145
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,400
{\an8}欢迎来到西景

146
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,880
今天早上  他好像逃走了
and this morning, it looked like he flew the coop.

147
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,620
你失踪的这个人是证人保护计划里的
Your missing person is in the Witness Protection Program?

148
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,210
我已经联系了此人的朋友  亲戚...
I have contacted known associates, relatives...

149
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,000
我猜猜  他们也都没见到过他
And let me guess, none of them have seen him either?

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,480
不  他们根本不知道这号人
No. None of them have ever heard of him.

151
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,740
我觉得事情有些不对劲
Something seemed hanky to me,

152
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,560
于是就买了从奥克兰起飞的第一架飞机
so I took the first flight out of Oakland

153
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,890
找当地的执法部门询问情况
to interface with local law enforcement,

154
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,340
结果发现了新的情况
which is when I encountered a new wrinkle.

155
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,940
什么情况
What is that?

156
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,020
来吧
Here we go.

157
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,140
抱歉  警长
Pardon me, Sheriff.

158
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,820
你能再和我同事
Would you mind repeating

159
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,700
说一遍西景的情况吗
your claim about Westview to my colleague here?

160
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,830
根本不存在
No such place.

161
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,690
你是说新泽西州的西景镇
You're saying the town of Westview, New Jersey,

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,620
根本不存在吗
doesn't exist?

163
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,960
我跟你的这位探员说了好几遍了  他就是不听
It's what I keep telling your G-Man here, but he won't listen.

164
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:18,020
我明白了  很抱歉  你是哪个镇子的人
I see. And, um, I'm sorry, what town are you from?

165
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,490
东景
Eastview.

166
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,280
谢谢你  治安官
Thank you, Sheriff.

167
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,030
如果我还有需要  会联系你的
I'll reach out if we need any further assistance.

168
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,770
我调取了镇上所有居民的号码
I, uh, pulled phone numbers for all the residents.

169
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,940
现在才看到D开头的  但目前一个都没查到
I'm only through the Ds, but so far I got Diddly Squat.

170
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,220
那么你联系不到里面的人
So you can't reach anyone inside

171
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,470
外面的人好像也得了什么选择性遗忘
and everyone on the outside has some sort of selective amnesia?

172
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,940
这不是什么失踪人口案
This isn't a missing person's case,

173
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,450
兰博上尉  是一个失踪的小镇
Captain Rambeau, it's a missing town.

174
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,820
3892人
Population 3,892.

175
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,470
{\an8}欢迎来到西景
家园由你创造

176
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,780
你为什么不进去调查
Why haven't you gone inside to investigate?

177
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,940
因为它不想让我进去
'Cause it doesn't want me to.

178
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,520
你也能感觉到  对吗
You can feel it too, can't you?

179
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,660
任何人都不准进去
Nobody's supposed to go in.

180
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,260
{\an8}天剑局

181
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,960
-那你呢  -我吗
- What about you? - Me?

182
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,730
我原本是贝克斯菲尔德的
Well, I'm from Bakersfield, originally.

183
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,750
我在那里长大  其他小孩墙上都贴迈克尔·乔丹
Growin' up, other kids had Michael Jordan posters on their walls,

184
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,510
我贴的是艾略特·尼斯[侦探]
but I had Eliot Ness.

185
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,410
不不不  我是说
No, no, no, no. I mean,

186
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,800
你为什么知道西景的存在
why is it that you have an awareness of Westview?

187
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,640
这么说的话   还有我
Or me, for that matter?

188
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,340
是因为我们是在特定范围外吗
Is it because we are outside of a certain radius,

189
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,290
还是说因为我们和这里的人没有人际关系
or maybe because we don't have a personal connection?

190
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,880
-等等  它飞到哪里去了  -刚刚就在这里啊
- Wait, where'd it go? - It was right there.

191
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,020
怎么回事
What is it?

192
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,710
好像有某种能量力场
Some sort of energy field.

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,250
小心点  兰博
Careful, Rambeau.

194
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,080
兰博上尉
Captain Rambeau!

195
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,860
小心
Watch it.

196
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,960
兰博
Rambeau!

197
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,470
兰博上尉
Captain Rambeau!

198
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,290
兰博上尉
Captain Rambeau!

199
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,850
{\an8}24小时后

200
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,030
你的专长是什么
What's your field?

201
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,000
我们不该交流的
We're not supposed to talk to each other.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
你是童子军队长  明白  你呢
Hmm? Boy Scout leader. Got it. And you?

203
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,230

天体物理学
Astrophysics.

206
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,190
这一车人可是各有本事啊
We got the full clown car.

207
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,290
这说明不管这威胁是什么
It means whatever the threat is,

208
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,910
天剑局显然不知道自己要面对的是什么东西
S.W.O.R.D. clearly has no idea what they're dealing with.

209
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,650
-我是一名化学工程师  -没有人关心
- I'm a chemical engineer. - No one cares.

210
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,960
好了  带上你们的装备
All right, grab your gear.

211
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,720
好了  那么...
All right. So, uh...

212
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,220
与此同时
In the meantime,

213
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,740
你们中一人去找霍奇报道
one of you guys check in on Hutch,

214
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,510
让他准备好升空无人机  明白了吗
make sure he's ready to get those drones up in the air. Okay?

215
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,270
-帮他一把  -谢谢
- Give him a hand. - Thanks.

216
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,320
{\an8}天剑局响应基地
新泽西州  西景镇外

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,350
刘易斯女士
Ms. Lewis?

218
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,530
刘易斯博士
Dr. Lewis.

219
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,520
我们已经在里面准备好你的装置了
We have your gear set up inside.

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,340
你们派进去的无人机收集到了什么样的数据
Those drones you're sending in, what kinda data are you getting?

221
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,760
恐怕这是机密
I'm afraid that's highly classified.

222
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,640
你什么都看不到吗
You can't see anything?

223
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,860
联调局  军队  我还看到了
FBI, Army. I saw the Air Force office

224
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,280
空军特别调查局
of Special Investigations out there.

225
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,220
还有研究实验室  航天指挥部
Research Lab, Space Command, too.

226
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,120
正式八经是多部门联合响应
A bona fide, joint, multi-service response.

227
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,440
很期待给我们发纪念文化衫哦
Looking forward to commemorative T-shirt.

228
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,620
一位女士要去哪里弄杯咖啡来
Is there somewhere a lady could get a cup of coffee?

229
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,010
你们好像要用那种小小的舱体下去
You guys look like you might get down with those little pod things.

230
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,360
-对环境特别不好  -请赶紧进行评估
- Horrendous for the environment... - Make your assessment, please.

231
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,200
这...
I mean, whoa...

232
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,840
你有什么发现
What're you getting?

233
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,530
大量CMBR
A colossal amount of CMBR.

234
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,930
-CM  -宇宙微波背景辐射
- CM... - Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation.

235
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,900
我们被告知辐射量在安全阈值内
We've been told the radiation is within a safe limit.

236
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,170
这...只是暂时的
Uh, it is... For now.

237
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,660
等等  什么叫...
Wait, what do you mean...

238
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,510
这些噪声上叠加了长波
There are longer wavelengths superimposed over the noise here.

239
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,410
我来吧
I got it.

240
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,190
我需要一台电视  老式的那种
I need a TV. An old one.

241
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,140
不是那种平面电视
Like, not flat.

242
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,740
-准备好了吗  -好了  先生
- You good to go? - Yes, sir.

243
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,090
你顺着这些管道就会进入镇子里
These sewers will take you straight into town.

244
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,270
-尽可能寻找兰博的痕迹  -收到
- Try to find anything you can on Rambeau. - Copy that.

245
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,380
富兰克林探员  我们会为你保持这个频道畅通
Agent Franklin. We will keep this channel open for you.

246
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,410
收到
Copy.

247
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,440
及时汇报情况
Keep me updated.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,430
海沃德局长
Director Hayward,

249
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,910
我们私下里说
between you, me, and the bedpost,

250
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,000
我对这次任务没什么信心
I am not confident about this mission.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,740
谢谢你的反馈  吉米
Thanks for the feedback, Jimmy.

252
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,200
要是我的无人机也像你一样愿意说话就好了
If only my drones were as forthcoming.

253
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,420
没理由怀疑
There's no reason to suspect

254
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,680
边界没有向地下延伸
the perimeter doesn't extend subterraneously.

255
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,910
也没理由怀疑它延伸了
There's no reason to suspect it does.

256
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,810
我们还不够了解这一威胁
We don't know enough about

257
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,530
第一名特工还没回来
the nature of the threat to send another agent

258
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,040
不应该再派一名过去
when the first is yet to return.

259
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,480
在匡提科肯定有人非常想念你
Someone must really miss you back in Quantico.

260
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,300
不  长官  垒球季结束了  长官
No, sir. Softball season's over, sir.

261
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,580
都用了哪些设备
What do we have up?

262
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,250
雷达  激光雷达  声雷达  红外线
Radar, lidar, sodar, infrared.

263
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,440
反复循环
Cycle through.

264
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,370
能不能给我个有意义的画面  该死
Will someone get me a useful visual, damn it?

265
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,380
那是什么
What is that?

266
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,970
-可以到厨房来一下吗  亲爱的  -谁在说话
- Can I see you in the kitchen, sweetheart? - Who's doing that?

267
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,210
-他们是谁  -你穿的是什么啊
- Who are those people? - What are you wearing?

268
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,260
-他们为什么会来  -你穿的是什么啊
- Why are they here? - What are you wearing?

269
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,070
-这不是我们的纪念日吗  -我们的什么纪念日
- Well, it's our anniversary! - Our anniversary of what?

270
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,700
如果你不知道  我才不告诉你呢
Well, if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you!

271
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,220
-那是...  -嗯  看着像她
- Is that... - Yeah, it looks like her.

272
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,420
你能以音速移动
You move at the speed of sound,

273
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,930
而我能让笔在空中飞
I can make a pen float through the air.

274
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,290
谁需要缩写了
Who needs to abbreviate?

275
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,370
我知道最近几年地球上发生了很多疯狂的事
Look, I know it's been a crazy few years on this planet,

276
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,680
但他不是死了吗
but he's dead, right?

277
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:49,120
不是闪烁  是真的死了
Not blipped, dead.

278
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,300
好计划  嫩肉剂在哪
Excellent plan. Where's the tenderizer?

279
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,730
这是什么情况
What am I looking at?

280
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,990
你  这是什么  从哪来的
You? What is this? Where's this coming from?

281
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,920
从那边
Out there.

282
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,150
我敲后门你没开  给你做倒置水果蛋糕的
You didn't answer the back door. For your upside-down cake.

283
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:02,070
我...
Oh! Hi, I...

284
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,720
-是真的吗  -我不知道该怎么回答
- Is it authentic? - I'm not sure how to answer that.

285
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
是实时发生的吗  是预先录好的  捏造的吗
Is it happening in real time? Is it recorded, fabricated?

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,350
我不知道  我不知道  我还是不知道
I don't know. I don't know. And I don't know.

287
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,800
你知道什么
What do you know?

288
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,570
我的设备探测到了极高的宇宙微波背景辐射水平
My equipment registered an extremely high level of CMBR.

289
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,960
-就是...  -可以追溯到大爆炸时期的遗留辐射
- That's... - Relic radiation dating back to the Big Bang.

290
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,680
是啊  缠绕着一个广播频率
Yeah, entwined was a broadcast frequency.

291
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,650
所以我让你的手下给我买了一台可爱的老式电视机
So I had your goons pick me up a sweet vintage TV.

292
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,960
我给这家伙插上电以后  瞧瞧  有声音有画面
And when I plug this bad boy in, voilà, sound and picture.

293
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,160
晚餐好了
Dinner is served.

294
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,020
你是说
So you're saying

295
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,560
宇宙创造了一部情景喜剧  主角是两个复仇者
the universe created a sitcom starring two Avengers?

296
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,950
欧洲风情
European.

297
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,420
这个理论还在完善中
It's a working theory.

298
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,850
现在就带我回总部
Get me a transport back to headquarters now.

299
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,680
-录下来了吗  -一直没停
- Are we recording this? - Never stopped.

300
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,370
我需要立即分析  各位  快行动
I need immediate analysis. Now, people. Let's go!

301
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,180
他真有魅力
He's a charmer.

302
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,890
-干得好  -谢啦
- Great work. - Hey, thanks!

303
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,740
现在可以给我咖啡了吗
Maybe I could get that coffee now?

304
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,640
不给也行  没事
Or not. That's cool.

305
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,770
首先  我们的主要目标
First and foremost, our main objective

306
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,280
是获取关于兰博上尉的信息
is to get any intel on Captain Rambeau,

307
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,250
但最初这是起失踪人口案
but originally, this case was a missing person,

308
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,040
所以我们从那查起
so we're going to start there.

309
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,320
我们已经成功辨认出
We've successfully identified

310
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,270
西景异象中的两个人
two individuals inside the Westview anomaly.

311
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,130
大家继续
Let's keep going.

312
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,840
本客人要离开你家了
This guest is leaving your home.

313
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,910
谢谢你们来
Yes, thank you for coming.

314
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:46,180
{\an8}未知情况
为何是六边形

315
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,350
哈特夫妇  由托德和莎伦·戴维斯扮演
Mr. And Mrs. Hart. Played by Todd and Sharon Davis.

316
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,440
计算表格  没有人能像你那样
Computational forms. And no one can process the data

317
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,040
-处理数据  伙计  -吴探员
- quite like you do, pal. - Agent Woo.

318
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,980
你就像台行走的电脑
You're like a walking computer.

319
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,140
阿比拉什·坦登就是诺曼
Abhilash Tandon is Norm.

320
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,000
{\an8}未知情况
为何是六边形
为何是情景喜剧
同一时空吗
幻视还活着吗

321
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,250
哈罗德·考普特就是琼斯
Harold Copter is Jones.

322
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,920
伊莎贝尔·松枝扮演贝芙莉
We got Isabel Matsueida cast as Beverly.

323
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,830
约翰·科林斯演赫
John Collins as Herb.

324
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,110
-真的吗  -你觉得她看起来还好吗
- Really? - Does she seem okay to you?

325
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,830
她看来并没受到任何伤害
Well, she doesn't appear to be harmed in any way,

326
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,450
但那绝对不是我昨天遇见的霸气女人
but that is definitely not the boss lady I met yesterday.

327
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,750
难道是什么潜伏  莫妮卡必须假装配合
So what, deep cover? Monica has to play along?

328
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,810
配合谁  或是配合什么
With whom? Or else, what?

329
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,110
好了  说重点  刘易斯博士
All right. Brass tacks, Dr. Lewis.

330
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:51,110
这是什么情况  另一个现实吗
What are we lookin' at here? Is it an alternate reality?

331
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,170
时间旅行  还是荒谬的社会实验
Time travel? Some cockamamie social experiment?

332
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,440
是情景喜剧  50年代的情景喜剧
It's a sitcom. A 1950s sitcom.

333
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,440
但为什么啊
But why?

334
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,400
哥们  我知道的和你一样少
Hey, man, we're working with the same scarcity of intel.

335
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,840
不过听着  我倒是有个主意
But, listen, I do have an idea.

336
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,420
你看见旺达厨房桌面的那个收音机了吧
So, you've seen that radio in Wanda's kitchen counter, right?

337
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,800
她下次洗碗的时候
The next time she's washing dishes,

338
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,570
据我计算  大概每集要洗一次  呕
which, by my count, happens about once an episode, barf,

339
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,860
我们就发射信号给那小家伙
we'll shoot a signal to that little guy.

340
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,960
这发射机会放送播送频率
This transmitter will mimic the frequency of the broadcast,

341
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,330
如果我没推测错  能让我们直接和她对话
and if my theory is right, allow us to speak directly to her.

342
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,520
这绝对能成功  别碰那个
This is totally gonna work. Don't touch that.

343
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,440
吴探员
Agent Woo.

344
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,520
是当前这一集的画面吗
Is this from the current episode?

345
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,200
-大概两分钟前播出的  -怎么了
- Aired about two minutes ago. - What is it?

346
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,170
你觉得这像什么
What does it look like to you?

347
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,810
复古版的天剑局无人机
Like a retro version of a S.W.O.R.D. drone?

348
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,790
-对了  -但它怎么改变的  为什么变了
- Bingo. - But how did it change and why?

349
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,750
为了配合剧中的设计吗
Uh, to go with the production design?

350
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,850
或是为了让它失效
Or render it useless.

351
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,210
-你为什么要给它上色  -我没有
- Why'd you colorize it? - I didn't.

352
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,630
我们开始吧
Let's get this show on the road.

353
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,570
吉米  你准备好了吗
Jimmy, you ready?

354
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,260
好了
Ready.

355
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,660
这个盛会举办得越来越大  越来越好
...bigger and better every season.

356
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,530
吉米  莫妮卡正在跟旺达说话
Uh, Jimmy, Monica is talking to Wanda.

357
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,250
她现在得到更好的角色了
She's got a speaking part now.

358
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,260
她说了什么
What is she saying?

359
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,970
这条裤子可真漂亮
Those pants are peachy keen.

360
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,040
她喜欢旺达的裤子
She likes Wanda's pants.

361
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,660
距离表演开始只有几个小时了
We only have a few hours...

362
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,720
旺达参加了某种泳池俱乐部
Wanda's at some sort of swim club.

363
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,310
我们都没见过
We've never been here before.

364
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,940
现在还是六十年代吗
Is it the '60s still?

365
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,550
旺达在跟别人说话了
Uh, uh, Wanda's with another character.

366
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,810
真人吗
Real person?

367
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,520
我不禁在想
I can't help but wonder

368
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,790
我们是不是一开始没给彼此留下好印象
if you and I haven't gotten off...

369
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,780
桌子上有收音机  你说话吧
Ooh, uh, radio on the side table. Start talking.

370
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,170
旺达  旺达  能收到吗  完毕
Wanda. Wanda, can you read me, over?

371
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,420
我不
I don't...

372
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,500
-她听见了吗  -应该没有  继续说
- Can she hear me? - I don't think so. Keep trying.

373
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,630
旺达
Wanda?

374
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,360
旺达
Wanda?

375
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,820
旺达  是谁把你变成这样了  旺达
Wanda. Who is doing this to you, Wanda?

376
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,540
旺达  你能听见吗  我是来帮你的
Wanda? Can you hear me? I'm here to help you.

377
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,140
请给我们一个
Please give us a...

378
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,890
突击测验  旺达
Pop quiz, Wanda.

379
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,040
家庭主妇如何洗掉白亚麻布上的血迹
How does a housewife get a bloodstain out of white linen?

380
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,080
等等
Wait.

381
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,400
-怎么了  -我不知道
- What? - I don't know.

382
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,950
答案是  自己洗
By doing it herself.

383
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,870
-好奇怪  -什么奇怪
- That was weird. - What was?

384
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,920
人们说男人有这两样重要配饰
They say a man is never fully-dressed without two important...

385
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,070
没事
Nothing.

386
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,020
结束了  任务失败
It's over. Mission failure.

387
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,490
至少值得一试  辛苦了  博士
It was worth a try. Good effort, Doctor.

388
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,370
没事  回来吧
Yeah, come on in.

389
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,260
富兰克林探员
Agent Franklin,

390
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,000
你距离围墙还有五米距离
we have you five meters outside of the perimeter.

391
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,040
富兰克林探员
Agent Franklin?

392
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,260
旺达
Wanda.

393
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,360
不
No.

394
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,370
这样好多了
Oh, that's better.

395
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,230
亲爱的  你觉得现在该...
Darling, do you think it's time to...

396
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,550
-叫医生吗  -是的
- Call the doctor? -Yeah.

397
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,960
我觉得没错  亲爱的
Yes, I do, dear.

398
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,420
五十年代  六十年代  现在是七十年代
1950s, 1960s, and now the '70s.

399
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,240
为什么时代一直在变
Why does it keep switching time periods?

400
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,700
肯定不是为了迎合我的口味吧
It can't be purely for my enjoyment.

401
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,500
我不敢相信旺达和幻视竟然有孩子了
And I can't believe Wanda and Vision are having a baby.

402
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,610
你想要孩子吗
You want any?

403
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,120
我当然想过
Heck, I thought about it for sure.

404
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
小小的吉米·吴
A little Jimmy Woo.

405
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,650
给他戴上小小的联调局警徽
Get him a tiny little FBI badge. Oh, you...

406
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,690
薯片吗  好的
Chip? Sure.

407
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,050
你做得很好
You're doing great.

408
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,340
你做得很好  看着我  看着我
You're doing great. Look at me. Look at me.

409
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,940
完蛋了  要露馅了
The jig is up.

410
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,460
该开始用力推了  你准备好了吗
It's time to start pushing. You ready?

411
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,210
推  旺达  用力推
Push, Wanda. Push!

412
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,230
他真完美
Oh, he's perfect.

413
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,110
双胞胎
Twins.

414
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,590
真是神转折
What a twist.

415
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,440
怎么了  我很投入
What? I'm invested.

416
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,010
他是被奥创杀死的  对吗
He was killed by Ultron, wasn't he?

417
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,160
她刚刚是说了奥创的名字吗
Did she just say the name Ultron?

418
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,010
这种情况之前发生过吗  提到现实中的事
Has that happened before? A reference to our reality.

419
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,170
从没有过
No. Never.

420
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,150
我来替你摇一会儿宝宝们吧
I'll take a shift rocking the babies.

421
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,020
不  我觉得你应该离开了
No, I think you should leave.

422
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,980
旺达  别这样
Oh, Wanda, don't be like that.

423
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,540
你是谁
Who are you?

424
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,770
旺达
Wanda...

425
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,960
这可有点不寻常了
Wow, this is different.

426
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,210
发生什么了  她去哪儿了
What happened? Where'd she go?

427
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,630
老天  别又这样
God, not again.

428
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,600
-你是谁  -旺达
- Who are you? - Wanda...

429
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,510
什么也找不到
There's nothing here.

430
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,630
前一秒  莫妮卡还站在那儿呢
One second, Monica is standing right there,

431
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,270
下一秒  她就不见了
and the next, she isn't.

432
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,240
有人正在修改这个节目
Someone is censoring the broadcast.

433
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,540
但是兰博去哪里了
But where's Rambeau?

434
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,770
警报  边界被侵入
Alert! Boundary has been breached!

435
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,310
警报  边界被侵入
Alert! Boundary has been breached!

436
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,960
警报  边界被侵入
Alert! Boundary has been breached!

437
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,080
你是谁
Who are you?

438
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,590
我不
I don't...

439
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,840
你到底是谁
Who are you?

440
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,800
旺达  我只是你的邻居啊
Wanda, I'm just your neighbor.

441
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,030
那你怎么会知道奥创
Then how did you know about Ultron?

442
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,110
你不是我的邻居
You're not my neighbor.

443
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,280
你也绝对不是我的朋友
And you're definitely not my friend.

444
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,090
你是陌生人  你是个外人
You are a stranger and an outsider.

445
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,380
而现在  是你擅闯了这里
And right now, you are trespassing here.

446
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,960
我要你离开这里
And I want you to leave.

447
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,490
我  我
I... I...

448
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,640
旺达
Wanda?

449
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,060
杰拉丁在哪
Where is Geraldine?

450
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,700
她走了  亲爱的  她急着回家去
Oh, she left, honey. She had to rush home.

451
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,940
怎么了
What?

452
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,640
怎么了  发生什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

453
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,380
我们不必待在这里
We don't have to stay here.

454
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,510
我们想去哪里都可以
We could go wherever we want.

455
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,080
不  不行
No, we can't.

456
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,680
这里是我们的家
This is our home.

457
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,260
你确定吗
Are you sure?

458
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,920
别担心  亲爱的  我有数
Oh, don't worry, darling. I have everything under control.

459
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,190
莫妮卡  你还好吗
Monica, are you okay?

460
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,460
是旺达
It's Wanda.

461
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,360
都是旺达做的
It's all Wanda.

462
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,580
我们今晚该看点什么呢
Well, what should we watch tonight?

463
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,420
{\an8}请稍后

464
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,260
{\an8}旺达幻视
